### The Plan

Over the years I figured out that the way to get myself to do something is through challenges so I decided to create another interesting challenge in order to keep myself busy.

So, for the following months (or years ðŸ˜…) I'll be going Live on my [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/florinpop) channel and build different streams of income and _hopefully_ go from $0 to a total of **$100k** in revenue from these projects.

I'll be going live every weekday (Monday to Friday), usually from 10AM Romania time (UTC+3).

I'm also going to document the entire journey and the projects which I'm building on this blog with short recap posts and also in recap videos on my YouTube channel.

### The Projects

When it comes to the projects which I'm going to build... I'm aiming to create small to medium sized projects which have the potential to scale easily without a lot of time commitment.

You can find the projects that I created or I'm working on [here](/projects).

## FAQ

### Which tech stack will you be using?

I'm going to try to use the stack which I'm most comfortable with (JavaScript with React, Next.JS, TailwindCSS) but at the same time if something better and faster comes along, I won't have a problem with switching.

### How long will it take to complete the challenge?

I don't know. It can take a month (most likely not), or it can take years. I'm aiming for 1 year though. But we'll see... ðŸ¤ž
