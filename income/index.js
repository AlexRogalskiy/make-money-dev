## YouTube Ads Revenue
Channel Link: [Florin Pop](https://youtube.com/florinpop)

I started this channel in November 2019. Uploaded 240+ coding videos and Live Streams, but then I burned out a bit and stopped uploading so much. In 2021 I want to get back to making at least 2 videos per week (on average).
### February 2021
**Revenue**: $257.74 <br/>
**Videos uploaded**: 0

### January 2021
**Revenue**: $462.18 <br />
**Videos uploaded**: 0

Can safely say that the entire revenue in 2021 _so far_ is due to my work in 2020.

## eBook Revenue
[Ten++ Ways to Make Money as a Developer](https://gum.co/makemoneydev)

Started the pre-sales for this eBook on 21st August 2020 and launched it on 14th December the same year. I tried a few marketing strategies _borrowed_ from Daniel Vasallo but it didn't work out so great for me.

I also added several affiliates but most of them didn't make any sales.

### February 2021
**Revenue**: $1,214.20 <br/>
**Copies sold**: 96

### January 2021
**Revenue**: $3,954.20 <br />
**Copies sold**: 163

I didn't do many sponsorship deals up until now (only a Twitter sponsorship), but I'm going to accept sponsors for this blog, Twitter posts and my YouTube channel as well.

## Freelancing Revenue
So far in 2021 I only took on a single small project (1-2 days of work). In case similar opportunities arise, I'm going to take them, but I'm currently not looking to get involved in big projects.
