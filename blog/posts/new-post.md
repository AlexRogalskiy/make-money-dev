I expect (and hope) that this blog will go a long way, but who knows what will actually happen in the future. Nevertheless, we'll have this article as a reminder of why I started this project in the first place.

There are several reasons why I decided to start this project. Let's go over what I have in mind.

## Monetize coding

As the domain name says, this blog will be about "_How to make money as a developer"_. I am a developer and you are either a developer too or you are dabbling with the idea of becoming one (otherwise I don't know why would you be reading this ðŸ˜¬) and you want to learn how you can monetize your coding skills.

There is much more to making money from coding than just the actual coding part. It involves some other skills too and we're going to go over those as well.

## Share my journey

I intend to use this blog to keep track of everything I'm going to do as a developer and as a content creator and at the same time to keep track of all the things which I'm going to learn along the way.

If you don't know me yet, just keep in mind that I love learning, experimenting, and sharing these things with my audience so this fits perfectly with the mission of this project.

Let's make a nice formula out of this:

> Learn + experiment + share = ðŸ’œ

Doesn't this look nice? I love it!

It works the other way around too where you first start by experimenting with the things you want to do and then draw conclusions and learn from those experiences.

## Teach others

The reason why I added the _sharing_ part in the equation is because I tend to believe that we can learn something from anyone - be it from a CEO or from just a simple, random person you meet online (or offline).

Thus, I believe that you can learn something from my journey as well. Not only that but I'll try my best to simplify the things that I'm going to learn so that you can get the most out of it and eventually use it on your journey.

## Leave a legacy

Over the years I want to look back on the things which I did and I want to be happy and fulfilled. I want to help and inspire as many people as I can to live life on their own terms, doing what they want, whenever they want.

I know that financial independence is not something you can achieve easily but at the same time I've seen people get there, so it's definitely possible and I want to help you get there.
